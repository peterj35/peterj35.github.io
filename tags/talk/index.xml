      <description>You can build it but will they come?
 In all my 8 years of building software, the biggest challenge is never building the software itself. It&amp;rsquo;s to get real users to actually use it.
 If a tree falls in a forest and nobody&amp;rsquo;s around to hear it, does it make a sound? Alternatively, if a website is published to the internet and nobody visits it, did it make a difference?</description>

      <description>I really enjoy learning things, which I hope everyone on our planet can attest to, so more uniquely, I like teaching people about those things. That&amp;rsquo;s something that really gets me motivated and fulfilled at the end of the day, it&amp;rsquo;s been the case since in my professional life explaining things to coworkers, the case when I was a TA back in university, or when I was tutoring kids English back in Korea.</description>

      <description>Biking  “It’s just a massive challenge. We’re in business to sell bicycles… and we have no bicycles.
 Michael Cranwell, general manager at Gears Bike Shop
Another way that Canada, and other parts of the world has changed since the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease, is the rise of recreational bikers.
Biking, even pre-pandemic has always had a special place in my heart. It is simply the best way to explore and navigate a new area for pleasure, if the conditions are suitable.</description>

      <description>Yet another strategy for restaurants to maximize patrons given the constraints during the panedemic, has been outdoor partios which have been converted from parking lots.
Just yesterday, a partial reopen phase began in Ontario, including the reopening of outdoor patios. One interesting difference between this reopen and the previous ones is the fact that last calls have been set back to pre-pandemic times (2AM), as opposed to the brutally tight 9PM in the previous reopen.</description>
