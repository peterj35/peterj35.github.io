      <description>For Pickr, which is a tournament playing app, I recently implemented a feature where after playing the game, the user would be shown an image of their play history.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my playthrough of the Most Entertaining Spier-Man movie of all time:
Spider-Man: Far From Home was the Spider-Man 2 of the Tom Holland era; characters were well established, the origin story told, and we were ready to have an awesome villain in Mysterio and a budding romance plot between Peter and MJ.</description>

      <description>With Pickr, one of the front end engineering philosophies I decided early on was to only design with an extreme mobile first mentality. Mobile first design refers to a design philosophy that aims to create better UX by starting the design process from the smallest of screens, which is mobile. Extreme mobile first refers to a design philosophy where every other design other than mobile is de-prioritized.
I made this assumption since I imagine most people visiting Pickr will experience mobile, and mobile only.</description>
