      <description>You can build it but will they come?
 In all my 8 years of building software, the biggest challenge is never building the software itself. It&amp;rsquo;s to get real users to actually use it.
 If a tree falls in a forest and nobody&amp;rsquo;s around to hear it, does it make a sound? Alternatively, if a website is published to the internet and nobody visits it, did it make a difference?</description>

      <title>Extreme Mobile First</title>

      <description>With Pickr, one of the front end engineering philosophies I decided early on was to only design with an extreme mobile first mentality. Mobile first design refers to a design philosophy that aims to create better UX by starting the design process from the smallest of screens, which is mobile. Extreme mobile first refers to a design philosophy where every other design other than mobile is de-prioritized.
I made this assumption since I imagine most people visiting Pickr will experience mobile, and mobile only.</description>

      <description>I really enjoy learning things, which I hope everyone on our planet can attest to, so more uniquely, I like teaching people about those things. That&amp;rsquo;s something that really gets me motivated and fulfilled at the end of the day, it&amp;rsquo;s been the case since in my professional life explaining things to coworkers, the case when I was a TA back in university, or when I was tutoring kids English back in Korea.</description>

      <description>What is Pickr? It is a tournament style game that can be played online. Players select a topic (or more commonly, may click on a link to find one) for the tournament to be based upon. When the game is opened, users are shown 2 random choices that are essentially contestants for the given topic.
I pick the Pomeranian, as I&amp;#39;m biased towards breeds with longer furThe player continues to play until only the victor remains, in continuous rounds.</description>
