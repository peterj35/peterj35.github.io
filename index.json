[{"content":"With Pickr, one of the front end engineering philosophies I decided early on was to only design with an extreme mobile first mentality. Mobile first design refers to a design philosophy that aims to create better UX by starting the design process from the smallest of screens, which is mobile. Extreme mobile first refers to a design philosophy where every other design other than mobile is de-prioritized.\nI made this assumption since I imagine most people visiting Pickr will experience mobile, and mobile only. By the point someone visits the desktop app, they are likely already a vested user, and a slight degradation in UX is worth the trade off for engineering velocity. In the future however, an elegant responsive design component system may be fun to explore and implement.\nThe largest challenge IMO when it comes to mobile first design is how to fit in all the damn content while still looking great and considered.\n\rOpacities are helpful to overlay content on top of each other, but they don\u0026#39;t provide the best UX. What do you think of the back button overlapping with the title above? How else would you design this?\r\rIn terms of implementation details, it is time now that the industry needs to embrace more specific responsive breakpoint names, that are better than mobile, tablet, and desktop. For Pickr, the only breakpoint which it responds, which is used sparingly, is actually if it is \u0026ldquo;less than or equal to mobile landscape\u0026rdquo;, at 767px. Although it is a quite wordy acronym (isLTEML), it is much more descriptive than isMobile or isCompact which can be vague.\nFinally, one of the biggest advantages that Pickr has compared to similar apps like piku, is the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s optimized for mobile. Pickr embraces mobile users first, and expects that desktop users will be fine with a slightly narrow experience.\nOf course, there are not many of these assumptions made directly in code, and in the future, it will be very easy to build out more desktop-considered designs by changing a few basic View components.\n","permalink":"http://peterj35.github.io/posts/mobile-first/","summary":"With Pickr, one of the front end engineering philosophies I decided early on was to only design with an extreme mobile first mentality.

We’re in business to sell bicycles… and we have no bicycles.\n Michael Cranwell, general manager at Gears Bike Shop\nAnother way that Canada, and other parts of the world has changed since the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease, is the rise of recreational bikers.\nBiking, even pre-pandemic has always had a special place in my heart. It is simply the best way to explore and navigate a new area for pleasure, if the conditions are suitable. It\u0026rsquo;s much faster than walking, which means you can cover way more ground, seeing much more. It\u0026rsquo;s incomparable to a car in terms of capturing an enjoyable \u0026lsquo;outdoor experience\u0026rsquo;, meaning you feel as if you are one with nature and not just being exposed to certain parts of it such as catching a breeze, or looking out the windshield. Above all else, it\u0026rsquo;s a fun physical exercise of maintaining balance, activating more muscles to climb ascents, then becoming hyper focused while blazing down the descents.\n\rMy Miyata\r\rGrowing up, the \u0026lsquo;nicest\u0026rsquo; bike that I had ever ridden was up to only about 100$ in value. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the lower to mid end mountain bikes sold in general stores like Walmart. When shopping for a bike last year, I finally wanted to try a road bike, because paved trails and roads were where I did most of my riding anyways. But, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready to drop a grand on a brand new one, so I turned to old trusty Kijiji for options.\nAfter narrowing down my choices for bikes that fit my physical specifications, such as the height and inseam, I found a blue Miyata sold by someone who fixed up vintage road bikes and sold them.\nHaving had it for a year, I can confidently say that going from a 100$ bike to a 400$ used one is worth your money. The riding is much more refined, meaning you\u0026rsquo;re not straining, you\u0026rsquo;re working. You maintain much more speed when cruising, meaning you can go longer without pedalling as much. You have an advantage over your co-riders who may have a heavier bike than you, and so forth.\nMusic Spotify has to be one of my favorite and most used applications. As an avid music listener, it has been game changing in my ability to keep and maintain my music, and to easily and explore new music.\nOut of my many playlists, one of them is a Classical / Jazz one, which I indeed listen to frequently while biking.\n   How do I listen to my music? With my True Wireless Jabra Elite Active 65ts of course! (not an affiliate link or sponsored post. Jabra, you can reach out to me on Twitter).\nWait a minute, isn\u0026rsquo;t listening to stuff with earbuds dangerous while you\u0026rsquo;re doing things where you should be aware of your surroundings? For those of you who think that, I have two words: risk tolerance. Actually, I have a little more than that. A study published in 2011 concluded that no negative effects were found when listening to music using only one earbud, and I only listen to music with one earbud.\nFrom that playlist, some of my favorite while biking are:\n Cinema Paradiso - Ennio Morricone Dolce Vita - Taro Hakase B Rossette - Blue Phoenix Stardust - Ben Webster Overture (Whiplash) - Justin Hurwitz Mascagni: Cavelleria Rusticana/Leoncavallo  ","permalink":"http://peterj35.github.io/posts/biking-with-classical-music/","summary":"Biking  “It’s just a massive challenge.

One interesting difference between this reopen and the previous ones is the fact that last calls have been set back to pre-pandemic times (2AM), as opposed to the brutally tight 9PM in the previous reopen.\nThanks to a good friend who made reservations, we were able to get in in due time past a bustling lineup which was there until past 11pm. Boy was it nice to be out and about again.\n\rThe \u0026#39;Rendezviews\u0026#39;, which pre-pandemic was just a boring old parking lot\r\rI\u0026rsquo;m all for these new ways to squeeze operational space based on the different reopen phases. We gotta do what we gotta do in order to satisfy the constraints which are being set, which we are hoping that the guys setting the rules know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing and that they\u0026rsquo;ve thought it through. Which by the way doesn\u0026rsquo;t always happen.\nA couple months ago, due to restrictions set at the province level, the Ottawa-Gatineau border (which is a series of bridges which connect the Ontario Ottawa to the Quebec Gatineau areas) had local police operated checkpoints to ensure that the traveler was going across for essential reasons. What ended up happening is that it took commuters who at 8am are just trying to get to their jobs, take an extra 2 hours just to get to a job that they likely weren\u0026rsquo;t thrilled about commuting to in the first place.\n\rPolicies set by governments have real impact on real people, just in case that needed to be reiterated\r\rTo the government\u0026rsquo;s credit (I could really be a bit more informed about at which level of the governments these things are being appealed and readjusted, the \u0026lsquo;government\u0026rsquo; is too broad a term), just a couple days later at least the Ottawa to Gatineau border check was removed, and in the couple times I had to go over to the other side a week or so later, there were no checks being performed. Sure, we could sit around and blame the system for having caused these delays without the foresight that it would create this amount of traffic congestion just given the sheer volume of commuters and the time it takes to do a road check, I\u0026rsquo;m still happy that they at least were willing to make things right, and right fairly quickly.\nThat was a bit of a tangent about my stance towards these policies, reopening phases and such. Anyway, as someone who likes socializing with people, it\u0026rsquo;s great to think that there are people out there looking at parking lots which became emptier due to the pandemic, to turn it into a nice outdoor area where some sense of normalcy could be presented. Yes I know they\u0026rsquo;re not exactly alturists who just want to accomodate people having a good time.\nNot everyone is this upbeat about patios. There was a reddit post which was getting a lot of visibility today, below is a screenshot of the original post:\n\rYikes\r\rThere\u0026rsquo;s no need to go too in depth about what I think about that post, but I find it though-provoking how some people can hold such negative sentiments, and only see the negatives of the activities or pass-times we partake in life.\nHere comes my final point for today. At the Rendezviews tonight, there was some wackiness and silliness that was taking place, which was a bit more energetic than what I observed generally at pre-pandemic levels. I wondered if it\u0026rsquo;s a sign of pent up need to express themselves.\nThese days when I\u0026rsquo;m outside, I do find myself having a refreshed perspective. As a collective we were, and still are, undergoing some unique times. Ontario was under a stay at home order from January to March, then from April to June, so you can\u0026rsquo;t blame people for forgetting how we behave or interact with other people, kinda like a small reset in our mental models for appropriate behaviour. Another series of incidents that I think support this hypothesis might be how when the NBA started having fans again at games, there was some unruly fan behaviour (such as spitting on a player, dumping popcorn over) which took place almost every day for I think 5 or 6 days. Pre-pandemic, the most notable fan inappropriateness that I remember is the Malice at the Palace, which was way back in 2004, and so it was again an oddity that the league had such frequent fan misbehaviour right after opening up.\n","permalink":"http://peterj35.github.io/posts/gradual-reopen/","summary":"Yet another strategy for restaurants to maximize patrons given the constraints during the panedemic, has been outdoor partios which have been converted from parking lots.\nJust yesterday, a partial reopen phase began in Ontario, including the reopening of outdoor patios.

It is a tournament style game that can be played online. Players select a topic (or more commonly, may click on a link to find one) for the tournament to be based upon. When the game is opened, users are shown 2 random choices that are essentially contestants for the given topic.\n\rI pick the Pomeranian, as I\u0026#39;m biased towards breeds with longer fur\r\rThe player continues to play until only the victor remains, in continuous rounds. The interface is as simple as it gets, you are given two choices, and you click or tap the one you prefer.\nThe thing that makes this truly interesting though of course, is that a ranking of all the choices are presented. The choices are sorted first by the total number of games that a choice has remained as the supreme victor, then by the number of intermediate rounds that were played to complete that game.\nAn important note to be made about Pickr though, is that it is not a ranking app of preferences. The selections of choices are made at random, and face off against each other randomly, meaning that in theory a player\u0026rsquo;s number 1 and 2 choices may face off in the first round. Whatever rank or tree that\u0026rsquo;s generated from that, the player\u0026rsquo;s number 2 choice will have been unfairly ranked. What could be introduced as a remedy for this, would be a separate loser\u0026rsquo;s bracket, to give opportunities for the number 2 choice to redeem itself, but that would be besides the point. And what is the point you ask? Pickr is not meant to be a strict record per se of anything. It\u0026rsquo;s not meant to be the next way to poll for preferences, or a replacement for something like Strawpoll. Instead, what Pickr does, and does very well, is encourage this very act of making the binary decision, by managing focus of the players.\nIn a world practically filled with an infinite number of distractions, Pickr narrows your focus to the given topic you have selected, then narrows it down further to 2 choices, and you simply choose one or the other. The vague topic title and description may dictate how you may be encouraged to choose, but at the end of the day, you are free to arbitrarily choose on whatever internal criteria, of the two that were presented to you.\nAnyone in the world can create a topic, and it can be shared equally with anyone, by sharing the link.\nAsk yourself, is there any field, no matter how trivial, in which you have a strong opinion on? Or perhaps you are a part of a community with a rabid fanbase? If you want to focus the attention of peers, or an online community for a while, based on the topic you\u0026rsquo;ve created \u0026ndash; you can do that using Pickr.\n","permalink":"http://peterj35.github.io/posts/introducing-pickr/","summary":"What is Pickr?
